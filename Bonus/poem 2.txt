“Lantern of Quiet Hours”

In the hush between the moments
where the ticking clocks grow shy,
a lantern made of gentle thoughts
hangs softly from the sky.

It glows with all the might-have-beens
and every whispered dream,
spilling silver on the stillness
like moonlight on a stream.

And if you walk beneath its light
with worries in your hand,
they’ll lift like seeds in summer wind
and drift across the land.

For in the quiet hours,
where the tender shadows start,
the world remembers how to breathe
and listens to the heart.
