“The Map in the Wind”

A breeze unfolded at my feet,
a map the wind had drawn—
inked in scents of distant rain
and colors of the dawn.

It pointed toward a hidden place
where footsteps learn to fly,
where echoes perch on branches
and watch the world go by.

I followed where the paper led,
though roads were never clear;
sometimes the truest journeys
begin with doubt and fear.

And when the path grew quiet,
the wind returned again—
reminding me that some maps
are meant to shift like skin.

For every heart that wanders
finds truths it didn’t seek:
the world is wide with wonder,
and courage starts with a single speak.
