In lines of code, a world takes shape,  
From tangled thoughts, new paths escape.  
A semicolon, a brace, a loop,  
Ideas converge, a woven troupe.  

Errors whisper, red and loud,  
Yet fixing them makes you proud.  
Each bug defeated, each test passed,  
A fragile dream made strong at last.  

Logic dances, syntax sings,  
From simple scripts to complex things.  
And in the silence of the night,  
A coder builds with pure delight.  

So let the keys click, steady, true,  
For every program reflects you.  
In code we craft, in code we find,  
The endless power of the mind.
