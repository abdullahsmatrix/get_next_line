In realms of logic, a digital art,
Lines of instruction, a mind, a heart.
From print("Hello") a journey begins,
Where structure and rhythm build systems within.
A variable holds a transient state,
A loop repeats the turns of fate.
If this condition, then action true,
Else another path we pursue.
Functions and modules, an elegant dance,
Organize structure, no room for chance.
From Python's grace to C++'s might,
Code translates thought into function and light.
It powers the world, unseen, yet vast,
From simple ideas, a future is cast.
In every bracket and every semicolon,
A whispered command, a story is spun.
